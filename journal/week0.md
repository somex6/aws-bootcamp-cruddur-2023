# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

## Introduction

The bootcamp training started with guide on how to do a technical presentation on a company's proposed architecture that will be implemented so it can be reviewed by the fractional CTO of which the presentation must include a technical architectural diagram and breakdown of possible services used along with their justification. And the company wants to generally know what spend we expect to encounter and how we will ensure we keep our spending low.

The infrastructure we will be setting up which I recreated with Lucid chart is shown below:

So to practicalize this, the following shows how I setup a budget of a zero-spend and a billing alarm to notify me when I'm above the budget.
